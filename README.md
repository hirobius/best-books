Make a list of each personâ€™s strengths.

Prabin
- Backend/Architecture

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
- Prabin will lead the backend in collaboration with Adrian
- Adrian will lead the frontend in collaboration with Prabin

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Adrian
- How things work under the hood and why (Backend)

Prabin
- Polish up frontend (Styling and Design)

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

- Read the Trello Feature Task
- Verbalize our Thinking of what we need to build
- Make a plan of of attack for what to build
- Alternate between Driver/Navigator as needed with the goal of 50/50 in mind

Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
- Handle at the lowest level first. Meaning: try to work it out with each other, then move "up the chain" as needed
- If the above is leading to more friction, reach out for TA/Instructor guidance

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
- Verbalize concerns and follow the above approach

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- We will leverage each other's strengths and interests around each particular subject accordingly.
- We will do our best to make sure to bring each other along for the journey of building something great
